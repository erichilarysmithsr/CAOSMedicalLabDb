## CORN FlakeS

### Content Object Resource Network Flake Server:  A Health Content Resource Information Management System for Emergent APHID

#### Routinization of ePHI from some public entity to a medical data storage and medical warehouse system.

#### Purpose of CORNFlakeS

&#x20;   The purpose of CORNFlakeS is to build or create, and execute an Agency-Based Relationship modeling system in medically indigent communities within the 50 wards of the city of Chicago.  Especially during these hard times as COVID-19 added a vector to its beginning menacing biomechanistic conformation in terms of SARS-COV-2.  Then, the sum of all fears with both COVID-19 and SARS-COV-2 vectors resulted in a new conformation of the Delta variant.  Then on from the Delta variant of the original virus vector, it change its conformation again to the Omicron variant with no microbial lag phase in sight in the latter of 2021.  From the latter of 2021 until now, the city of Chicago and the rest of the world was hit again by the sum of all fears of the resultant vector of the Flurona variant of the original COVID-19 conformation. &#x20;

As a result of Flurona hitting the Chicago area, the food service industry was hit by a food industry vector in major food corporations like McDonald's, Burger King, Wendy's, Starbucks, and Dunkin Donuts on January 3, 2022 had began putting major stipulations in medically underserved communities.  For example, by requiring all health care consumers to take unnecessary extreme measures before entering their restaurant or coffee house.  Upon entering their restaurant or coffee house, each health care consumer must show an ID and proof of COVID-19 immunization series from Moderna and Pfizer (Unfortunately, both health care companies are not clearly reachable on Twitter or Cisco Webex at this time.) before they can sit down and eat a meal with a family, friend, neighbor, coworker, or classmate.  According to the APA, this may cause further mental health problems within those segmented groups.  By the restaurant industry putting these costly extreme measures in place, more barriers were created to poor health care in medically underserved communities, especially among immunocompromised wards in Chicago containing dense populations of Native American, African American, Latino American, Asian American, and Middle Eastern Americans. &#x20;

These barriers that may lead to further poor health in immunocompromised wards with dense populations of minorities must be intercepted with CORNFlakeS Agency-Based Relationship modeling system.  CORNFlakeS as a Agency-Based modeling system must build or create and develop various types of relationships in medically underserved communities.  One type of relationship is the Human-Agent interaction model.  Another type of relationship is the Agent-Web Application interaction model.  The purpose of these two types of interaction models is to decrease slow response times (which maybe revealed through a decision tree diagram) of a public health worker within any agency that maybe experiencing health care delivery service problems related to COVID-19 or any endemic, epidemic, and pandemic health problems that may be coevolving in the city of Chicago. &#x20;

#### What is Routinization?

&#x20;   According to Robin Leidner, author of the book "_Fast Food, Fast Talk:  Service Work and the Routinization of Everyday Life_" stated in chapter two, "Routinization appeals to employers of interactive service workers for the same reasons that it attracts employers of manufacturing and clerical workers.  The routinization of interactive service work is not a new phenomenon-the work of telephone operators, for example, was routinized by the first years of the twentieth century-but it is becoming increasingly widespread.  With the rapid expansion of the service sector in the United States in the postwar period, the cost and quality of interactive work have assumed greater significance in many organizations, making it more attractive to try to apply the principles of routinization developed for use in manufacturing work to human interactions."  Not just only in human interactions, but also in non-human interactions, routinization is applicable to the U.S. health care system with our current pandemic crisis with COVID-19 since 2020.  Also, routinization is applicable in every community where there is a human service organization that is suppose to serve those living with food insecurity and mental health issues, which may have been caused by anthropogenic etiologies.&#x20;

#### Routinization fueling Agent Interoperability according to HIPAA

Also, interactive service workers can be utilized through Google and all its third party apps, like Pusher's API via serviceworker.js file.  However, it can have web app access through Pory App and Google via Android for public consumption.

#### &#x20;COMET FISH for Public Consumption

* CAOS Objects that are for Medical Terminology Fast Information Service 4 Health.  Fast Information Service 4 Health will take into priority medically underserved communities in Chicago.  It will take into priority the medically indigent to access public services.  COMET FISH is for medically underserved and medically indigent public users that may be currently experiencing access to health care issues caused by barriers on the southside and westsides of Chicago.  These barriers may be related to deinvestment in the wards located on the southside and westsides.  So, again, the purpose of COMET FISH Public UI access is to decrease disparities related to chronic disease management in wards where deinvestment may have occured before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic crisis.
