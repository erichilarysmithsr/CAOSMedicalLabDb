#### What is Routinization?

&#x20;According to Robin Leidner, author of the book "_Fast Food, Fast Talk:  Service Work and the Routinization of Everyday Life_" stated in chapter two, "Routinization appeals to employers of interactive service workers for the same reasons that it attracts employers of manufacturing and clerical workers.  The routinization of interactive service work is not a new phenomenon-the work of telephone operators, for example, was routinized by the first years of the twentieth century-but it is becoming increasingly widespread.  With the rapid expansion of the service sector in the United States in the postwar period, the cost and quality of interactive work have assumed greater significance in many organizations, making it more attractive to try to apply the principles of routinization developed for use in manufacturing work to human interactions."  Not just only in human interactions, but also in non-human interactions, routinization is applicable to the U.S. health care system with our current pandemic crisis with COVID-19 since 2020.
